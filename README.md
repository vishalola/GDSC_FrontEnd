## About the game "Wordle":
    
    Wordle gives players six chances to guess a randomly selected five-letter word. As shown above, if you have the right letter in the right spot, it         shows up green. A correct letter in the wrong spot shows up yellow. A letter that isn't in the word in any spot shows up gray.

    A player has six chances to guess the correct word.

## About the project and its development:

    This is a frontend React based project made by Vishal Ola made for Round 2 of GDSC's interview. Inspiration is taken from The New York Times' Wordle. 
    This project's code (all of CSS, JS, and JSX)  is written solely by Vishal Ola and is plag-free.

## Developer's message:
    Hi! I'm Vishal Ola. I've made this project in a span of two days (I was busy with OpenCode organised by IIITA). Being a beginner, I understand I might have made some mistakes. I've tried to make this project as bug-free as possible. 
    Any suggestion is most welcomed!
